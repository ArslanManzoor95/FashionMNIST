# FashionMNIST: PyTorch Tutorial (Quickstart)
PyTorch tutorial on FashionMNIST dataset

This repository contains my Jupyter notebook for the [PyTorch Quickstart Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html). The tutorial is a beginner-friendly introduction to PyTorch, a popular machine learning framework.

## Tutorial Overview

The Quickstart tutorial is a hands-on introduction to PyTorch basics, including the following key concepts:

- Tensors: The fundamental data structures of PyTorch.
- Datasets & DataLoaders: Tools for handling and loading datasets.
- Model Building: Creating a neural network model using PyTorch's `nn` module.
- Autograd: PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine.
- Optimization: Training the model with backpropagation and optimization algorithms.
- Saving & Loading Model: Techniques for saving and reloading model parameters.

## Contents of the Notebook

The notebook covers the following sections:

1. Working with Data: Loading and preprocessing datasets.
2. Building the Neural Network: Defining a simple neural network class.
3. Training the Model: Steps to train the neural network using the training dataset.
4. Evaluating the Model: Testing the model's performance on the test dataset.
5. Saving the Trained Model: Demonstrating how to save a trained model.
6. Making Predictions: Using the model to make predictions on sample data.

## Running the Notebook

To run the notebook:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
2. Install PyTorch following the instructions on the [official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the repository directory and launch Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
5. Open the notebook file in Jupyter.
6. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.
